# Udacity Data Science Capstone

## Description

This project is a capstone requirement of the Udacity Data Science NanoDegree. The project is about data exploration and building a model for Starbucks rewards app data to determine what influences a customer to purchase or respond to an offer, based on the customer’s transaction data, demographic profile, and offer type.

## Installation
Install visuals.py and other Anaconda libraries of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python version 3.*.

## Project Motivation
For this project, I was interested in using Starbucks rewards app data. The objective of this project is to understand what influences a customer to purchase or respond to an offer. The analysis is based on customers’ transaction data, demographic profiles, and offer types. The full set of data was provided by Udacity.

## File Descriptions
There are 3 JSON files provided and available through Udacity's workspace:

portfolio.json - containing offer IDs and metadata about each offer (duration, type, etc.)<br>
profile.json - demographic data for each customer<br>
transcript.json - records for transactions, offers received, offers viewed, and offers completed<br>

The files included in this repo are: 
1. Starbucks_Capstone_Project.ipynb - Code in Jupyter Notebook
2. Starbucks_Capstone_Project.html - HTML copy of code
3. There is an additional visuals.py file that runs the necessary code to run the Jupyter notebook.

## Results
The main findings can be found here: https://data-project-steward.blogspot.com/2025/03/data-science-nanodegree-capstone.html

## Licensing
Must give credit to Udacity and Starbucks for the data.
