## Installation
Install visuals.py and other Anaconda libraries of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation
For this project, I was interested in using Starbucks rewards app data. The objective of this project is to understand what influence a customer to purchase or respond to an offer. The analysis is based on customer’s transaction data, demographic profile, and offer type. The full set of data was provided by Udacity.

## File Descriptions
1.There are 3 json files provided through Udacity's workspace:

portfolio.json - containing offer ids and meta data about each offer (duration, type, etc.)<br>
profile.json - demographic data for each customer<br>
transcript.json - records for transactions, offers received, offers viewed, and offers completed<br>

2. Starbucks_Capstone_Project.ipynb - Code in Jupyter Notebook
3. Starbucks_Capstone_Project.html - HTML copy of code
4. There is an additional visuals.py file that runs the necessary code, to run the Jupyter notebook.
5. Starbucks_Capstone.PDF - Project documentation and results

## Results

## Licensing
Must give credit to Udacity and Starbucks for the data.
