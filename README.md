# Udacity Data Science Capstone

## Description

This project is a capstone requirement of Udacity Data Science NanoDegree. The project is about data exploration and building a model for Starbucks rewards app data, to determine what influence a customer to purchase or respond to an offer, based on customer’s transaction data, demographic profile, and offer type.

## Installation
Install visuals.py and other Anaconda libraries of Python. The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation
For this project, I was interested in using Starbucks rewards app data. The objective of this project is to understand what influence a customer to purchase or respond to an offer. The analysis is based on customer’s transaction data, demographic profile, and offer type. The full set of data was provided by Udacity.

## File Descriptions
There are 3 json files provided and available through Udacity's workspace:

portfolio.json - containing offer ids and meta data about each offer (duration, type, etc.)<br>
profile.json - demographic data for each customer<br>
transcript.json - records for transactions, offers received, offers viewed, and offers completed<br>

The files included in this repo are: 
1. Starbucks_Capstone_Project.ipynb - Code in Jupyter Notebook
2. Starbucks_Capstone_Project.html - HTML copy of code
3. There is an additional visuals.py file that runs the necessary code, to run the Jupyter notebook.

## Results
The main findings can be found here: https://lovelina-richter.medium.com/monday-coffee-b98c62606e2

## Licensing
Must give credit to Udacity and Starbucks for the data.
